# Project Name: Bike Sharing Assignment
> The bike-sharing service called BoomBikes seeks to make use of their data on bikes' sharing in order to
predict their sales by using machine learning by finding out the most important factors affecting the use 
of their bikes on a day-to-day basis. 


## General Information
-  A linear regression model needs to be made based on the given data to make it easy
for BoomBikes to predict the use of their servce by customers.
- The project is an assignment for an ML/AI course at UpGrad

## Conclusions

The demand of bikes (in descending order) depends mostly upon the following variables:

temp: Temperature of the region
Light_Rain/Snow: Light rain or snowfall in the region (negatively)
year: Year
spring: Spring (negatively)

And, to a lesser extent, on variables:

workingday
windspeed
july
mar
sep
mon
Misty
winter

The model successfully had the following R-values:

Training Dataset's R-squared value (R^2): 0.841
Test Dataset's R-squared value (R^2): 0.8013
Training Dataset's adj. R-squared value (adj. R^2): 0.837
Test Dataset's adj. R-squared value (adj. R^2): 0.7897
